# The Big Book of Small Python Projects
This is my repo following the book "The Big Book of Small Python Projects: 81 Easy Practice Programs" by Al Sweigart

Synopsis taken from the book:

"If you’re tired of standard step-by-step tutorials, you’ll love the learn-by-doing approach of The Big Book of Small Python Projects. It’s proof that good things come in small programs!"
