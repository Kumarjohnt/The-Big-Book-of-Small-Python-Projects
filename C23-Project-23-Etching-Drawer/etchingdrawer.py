"""Etching Drawer, by Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com
An art program that draws a continuous line around the screen using the
WASD keys. Inspired by Etch A Sketch toys.

For example, you can draw Hilbert Curve fractal with:
SDWDDSASDSAAWASSDSASSDWDSDWWAWDDDSASSDWDSDWWAWDWWASAAWDWAWDDSDW

Or an even larger Hilbert Curve fractal with:
DDSAASSDDWDDSDDWWAAWDDDDSDDWDDDDSAASDDSAAAAWAASSSDDWDDDDSAASDDSAAAAWA
ASAAAAWDDWWAASAAWAASSDDSAASSDDWDDDDSAASDDSAAAAWAASSDDSAASSDDWDDSDDWWA
AWDDDDDDSAASSDDWDDSDDWWAAWDDWWAASAAAAWDDWAAWDDDDSDDWDDSDDWDDDDSAASDDS
AAAAWAASSDDSAASSDDWDDSDDWWAAWDDDDDDSAASSDDWDDSDDWWAAWDDWWAASAAAAWDDWA
AWDDDDSDDWWAAWDDWWAASAAWAASSDDSAAAAWAASAAAAWDDWAAWDDDDSDDWWWAASAAAAWD
